# Sarcasm-detection-in-texts-using-various-models
Identifying sarcasm which is latent in a text is a challenging task. Here, I have attempted to detect sarcasm in news headlines dataset. NLP and DL techniques have been incorporated to achieve the same. The models used are CNN, RNN, BERT and LSTM. By assigning polarity scores to the texts, the contexts can be well discerned and texts can be segregated to identify if sarcasm or even humour is present in the data.
